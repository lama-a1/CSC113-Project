# CSC113-Project
# Flight Reservation System
The program is an airline flight reservation system that allows users to browse available
flights based on type, including domestic, international, business domestic, and premium
international flights. Users can make reservations, cancel bookings, and search for
reservations using a passenger ID and flight number. Each flight has a limited number of
available seats, and pricing may vary based on the flight category. The system ensures
smooth booking operations by managing flights, handling reservations, and maintaining
availability. It provides a structured approach to airline operations, allowing passengers
to check in, book seats, and modify reservations efficiently.
